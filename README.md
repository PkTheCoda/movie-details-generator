# movie-details-generator

This is a simple movie details generator I built using OMDB's movie API. It's a very simple program where the user just enters in a movie, TV Show, or episode, and the program will diplay these attributes for that input:

- Title of Film
- Plot of Film
- Poster/Picture of Film
- Runtime of F
