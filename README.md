# What is it?

This is a simple movie details generator I built using OMDB's movie API. It's a very simple program where the user just enters in a movie, TV Show, or episode, and the program will diplay these attributes for that input:

- Title of Film
- Plot of Film
- Poster/Picture of Film
- Release Date of Film
- Languages film is dubbed in
- Genres of film
- IMDB Rating
- Regular Rating (PG-13, R)
- Film Runtime
- Major Actors in Film
- Net Box-Office Revenue

# Example

Using this application is really simple! Once you open the site, you will be met with a screen that looks something like this:
<br>
<img width="1257" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PkTheCoda/movie-details-generator/assets/107774675/8adcc70b-31ad-4586-a8d6-db9536be4a14">
<br>
<br>

In the input on the left side, you can enter in a Movie, TV Show, Episode, or some other type of film. For the purposes of this example, I'll be using the movie "Super Mario Bros".

<br>
<br>

You can see all the different stats for the movie along with the plot, title, and a nice poster of the movie.

# My Experiences

This project was really not too hard. I made this with the knowledge of my other API Projects. In the past I made a project that shows you exercises based off of muscle groups and a weather checker application which will give you weather stats based off of a zipcode, city, or some sort of location. 

The reason why I made this project was that I wanted to improve my **ReactJS** skills. I had been learning **ReactJS** for about 2 weeks by now and I wanted to solidify concepts that I had learned like the useState() hook and passing in props and using them. This project really helped me learn those items and I learned a lot of different new skills like conditional rendering, props, reusable components, and much more.

As I learn more and more about **React**, I want to add onto this project in the future. Here is what I want to add:

- Be able to bookmark certain films
- Have those bookmarked films added to a certain page where you can view/open them fully
- Be able to "unbookmark" them. 

Overall, this was a great way for me to learn new skills and I want to continue to build better projects like this in the future. (Also work on my CSS since it's so bad!!)
